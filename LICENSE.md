### Preamble

The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works.

The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free software for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to any other work released this way by its authors. You can apply it to your programs, too.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.

For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.

For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains that there is no warranty for this free software. For both users' and authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions.

Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer can do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting users' freedom to change the software. The systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those products. If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.

Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could make it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.

### TERMS AND CONDITIONS

0. Definitions.

   - "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.
   - "Copyright" also means copyright-like rights such as those enforced by patent law.
   - "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License.
   - "You" and "your" refer to the individual or legal entity exercising this License.
   - "We", "us", and "our" refer to the Free Software Foundation, Inc., the licensor of the Program.

1. Source Code.

   The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. "Object code" means any non-source form of a work.

   The Program must include a copy of this License, and the following notice must appear in each file of the Program:

   ```
   This file is part of the [insert program name] project.
   [insert program name] is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
   it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
   the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or
   (at your option) any later version.
   ```

2. Basic Permissions.

   You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and distribute this License along with the Program.

   You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

   - a) The modified work must itself be a software program.
   - b) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
   - c) You must keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty.
   - d) You must distribute this License along with the Program.

3. Copyleft.

   You also have the permission to link or combine any part of the Program with other programs or libraries, and distribute the resulting combination under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

   - a) The combined work must itself be a software program.
   - b) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
   - c) You must keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty.
   - d) You must distribute this License along with the Program.

4. Additional Terms.

   "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the conditions of this License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. Additional permissions may be added to the end of the license notice for a file, or to this License, or may be included in a separate license notice.

   You may add your own additional permissions to your version of the Program, or delete or change the additional permissions in this License, provided that you do not remove or change the basic permissions above.

5. Disclaimer of Warranty.

   THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.

6. Acceptance.

   By copying, distributing or modifying the Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License and all its terms and conditions.
